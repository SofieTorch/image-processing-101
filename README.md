# Image processing 101

A web app to apply the things I learn about image processing, both on college and by myself.  

Currently it uses mainly NumPy, to work with an image as a matrix. This allowed me to learn better the algorithms used to manipulate images, did you know the brightness can be changed with just a matrix addition?  

>There are algorithms that can be applied to both RGB images and images on grayscale, however there are extra algorithms for images on grayscale only. Nevertheless, an image can be turned to grayscale on the web app, so don't worry 😸

## Features

| Feature | Available on RGB | Available on grayscale |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Brightness adjustment | ✅ | ✅ |
| Contrast adjustment | ✅ | ✅ |
| A nice filter I called "film" | ✅ | ✅ |
| Thereshold manipulation |  | ✅ |
| Solarization level |  | ✅ |
| Image histogram | ✅ | ✅ |

⚠️ Downloading the modified image is not currently possible.

>Hope you like it, is not always necessary to use complex libraries like OpenCV to manipulate images, images are just matrices at the end of the day. 👩‍💻
